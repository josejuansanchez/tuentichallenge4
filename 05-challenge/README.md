#### Challenge 5 - Tribblemaker 

After Bones returned from planet B3/S23 to the USS Enterprise, he rushed to the bridge to brief the captain about his discovery.

*– "Jim, I found a remarkable species on the planet! They're called Tribbles. Look at their reproductive patterns!"*

In the cage, Jim and Bones could see the animals spread out on the floor on a grid. They were quickly being born and dying, based on a proximity rule.

Spock intervened: "Fascinating. They seem to be following the standard rules described by the earthling Dr John Conway."

Bones added, "Damn it, I'm a doctor not a biologist. But don't you think that their position on the grid seems to follow a loop? Weren't they positioned like this a while ago? I wonder if we could predict it."

Chekov overheard the conversation and entered the room: "I can do this! I can do this! Just let me code a quick algorithm, it will be super easy."

#### Challenge

Chekov is a genius, but I'm sure you can do this as well. Given an initial grid of Tribbles, find the generations that define a loop. For example, if in generation 57 the pattern looks like it did in generation 5, we have a loop starting at generation 5 with period length 52.

The initial grid given is generation 0. The first generation you must calculate is generation 1.

#### Input

The file contains a grid given as an 8x8 pattern, which means it is comprised by eight lines with eight characters each. A dash (-) indicates a vacant cell and an X indicates a Tribble.

#### Output

Return a line containing two numbers separated by a space. The first one is the first generation of the loop and the second is the duration (period) of the loop.

The grid is guaranteed to loop eventually before reaching generation 100. The grid does NOT wrap around. Assume that any empty cells bordering the initial 8x8 cannot be populated.

#### Explanation of examples

This means that for the first grid, a loop starts at generation 1 that repeats every 2 generations (i.e. the grid alternates between two states: generation 3 will look like 1, etc). For the second grid, the loop starts at generation 0 and repeats its pattern with every generation (i.e., the grid never changes).
